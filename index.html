    <h1>Kenny's Hot Hatch Watchlist! </h1>
    <p>
      Hey everyone! This is my hot hatch portfolio, where I showcase some of my favorite hot hatches. I grew up loving cars, with short, stubby, but powerful little cars becoming my passion.
      These cars pack a ton of utility (with them being essentially mini SUVs in some cases), but somehow are fitted with crazy over-the-top engines that produce a ton of power. My favorite
      one, which will be in this webpage, is the Toyota GR Corolla.
