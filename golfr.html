    <h3>Volkswagon Golf R</h3>
    <p>
       This is the 2026 Volkswagen Golf R (this is most people's favorite). It's derived from the classic VW Golf, but with some crazy performance upgrades.
       For starters, the base-tier engine has been replaced with a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder that produces 328 hp. It stands as a fan favorite due to how long it has been around,
       over 20 years.
