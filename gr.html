    <h3>Toyota GR Corolla </h3>
    <p>
       This is the 2026 Toyota GR Corolla. It's considered the "underdog" or new kid on the block in the hot hatch world, as it's one of the newer entries in the market. It represents Toyota's return
       to the performance world, as it essentially takes a regular Corolla and pimps it out. With its suspension upgrades and manual custom sport transmission, the most mind-blowing part is its engine: 
       a turbo 3-cylinder making 300 hp (essentially 100hp per cylinder). Along with Toyota's reliability, it truly is an amazing car (and my favorite pick).
